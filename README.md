# DocuWeb22 - Documenting Web Data for Social Research
## A participatory workshop for developing structured and reusable practices 
A half-day, in person workshop at WebSci2022 in Barcelona!

### Workshop Description
With this half-day workshop, we want to collaboratively discover best practices as well as frequent pitfalls encountered when working with Web data. While the documentation of datasets is a well established standard in a wide range of disciplines, the documentation of Web data comes with a number of unique challenges - among them the potential influence of the collection process on the composition of the resulting dataset, or the use of automated processing methods that might not generalize well to the problem at hand. 
During the first part of the workshop, we will introduce and discuss existing frameworks and guidelines for research with Web data. We will cover approaches targeted at documenting specific parts of the research pipeline (datasets, models), approaches that encourage critical reflection inspired by the social sciences (total survey error), as well as a combination of the two. In the second part of the workshop, we hope to interactively explore different experiences and perspectives of the participants on the collection and documentation of Web data. We would therefore like to encourage everyone to follow our Call for Abstracts and share their views on the topic with us and the other participants. Lastly, we will collectively work on the documentation of a typical Web data collection process, discovering and discussing potential limitations and sources of error along the way.

### Call for Abstracts
- **Details:** We invite participants to share their past experiences with the collection and documentation of Web data. We formulate this Call for Abstracts as general as possible in order to collect the experiences and perspectives of a range of backgrounds, disciplines and research questions as wide as possible. This collection shall then serve as a basis for discussion of existing and possible future approaches to the successful documentation of high quality Web data. Examples of submissions we would expect to receive are reflections on challenges encountered and best-practices developed during past research projects, perspectives on and user-experiences with frameworks or methods for the assessment of Web data quality, or already created documentation sheets for previous data collections. Potential areas of interest include but are not limited to:
- potential and innovative use of web data for social inquiry
- frameworks or methods for assessing web data quality
- reflections of challenges in assessing, documenting web data
- **Requirements:** ...

- **Disclaimer:** The submissions made to this workshop will **not** be considered for publication in the conference proceedings, nor will they be published in any other venue. Submissions will only be used to foster conversation and exchange during the workshop.

### Organizers
[Leon Fröhling](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/staff/person/Leon.Froehling?no_cache=1) is a doctoral researcher in the department of Computational Social Science at GESIS, Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences, Cologne. He is interested in studying the ways in which theoretically derived research frameworks may be transferred into actual research practice. 

[Indira Sen](https://indiiigo.github.io/) is a doctoral researcher in Computer Science in the department of Computational Social Science at GESIS, Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences, Cologne. Her interest lies in understanding biases in inferential studies from digital traces, with a focus on natural language processing.

[Dr. Katrin Weller](https://katrinweller.net/) is an information scientist and leads the Digital Society Observatory team at GESIS’ Computational Social Science Department, and is co-lead of the Research Data and Methods Dept. at the Center of Advanced Internet Studies (CAIS).
