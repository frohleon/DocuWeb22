# DocuWeb22 - Documenting Web Data for Social Research
## A participatory workshop for developing structured and reusable practices 
A half-day, in person workshop at [WebSci'22](https://websci22.webscience.org/) in Barcelona! The workshop takes place **Sunday, June 26**. We encourage participants to attend in person in order to add to the debate, but will also make the first part of the workshop available for online participation.

### Workshop Description
With this half-day workshop, we want to collaboratively discover best practices as well as frequent pitfalls encountered when working with Web data. While the documentation of datasets is a well established standard in a wide range of disciplines, the documentation of Web data comes with a number of unique challenges - among them the potential influence of the collection process on the composition of the resulting dataset, or the use of automated processing methods that might not generalize well to the problem at hand. 

During the first part of the workshop, we will introduce and discuss existing frameworks and guidelines for research with Web data. We will cover approaches targeted at documenting specific parts of the research pipeline ([datasets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458723), [models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287596)), approaches that encourage critical reflection inspired by the social sciences ([total survey error](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/85/S1/399/6359490)), as well as a combination of the two. 

In the second part of the workshop, we hope to interactively explore different experiences and perspectives of the participants on the collection and documentation of Web data. We would therefore like to encourage everyone to follow our *Call for Participation* and share their views on the topic with us and the other participants (however, submission is not a requirement for participation in the workshop). Lastly, we will collectively work on the documentation of a typical Web data collection process, discovering and discussing potential limitations and sources of error along the way.

### Call for Participation (Abstracts)
- **Details:** To better tailor the workshop contents and discussions to the participants interest, we invite everyone to share their past experiences with the collection and documentation of Web data. We formulate this *Call for Participation* as general as possible in order to collect the experiences and perspectives of a range of backgrounds, disciplines and research questions as wide as possible. This collection shall then serve as a basis for discussion of existing and possible future approaches to the successful documentation of high quality Web data. 
Potential areas of interest include but are not limited to:
    - potential and innovative use of web data for social inquiry
    - frameworks or methods for assessing web data quality
    - reflections of challenges in assessing, documenting web data
    - ...
- **Benefits:** For those who submitted their perspectives and experiences we will aim to jointly discuss potential documentation strategies for their use cases. You will also get the chance to showcase your research in a spotlight talk (approx. 5 minutes).
- **Requirements:** Submissions may be as long as required by participants to share their experiences with and perspectives on the documentation of Web data. Our expectation would be that submissions range from 1 to 5 pages in length, without any formatting requirements in place. Please only submit if you are willing to also talk about your experiences during the workshop discussions.
- **Deadline:** June 19, 2022
- **Submission Details:** E-Mail for submissions following soon...
- **Disclaimer:** The submissions made to this workshop will **not** be considered for publication in the conference proceedings, nor will they be published in any other venue. Submissions will be used to foster conversation and exchange during the workshop, and will be shared with registered workshop participants only.
